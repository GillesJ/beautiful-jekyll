This page introduces PGP, its uses, and guides newcomers through the process of keysigning from generation to sending your freshly signed key to the server.

# Keybase.io: the good, the bad, the ugly
- The good: They wish to promote the use of PGP and make key retrieval slightly easier.
- The bad: Keybase.io has a follow function that allows people to psuedo-sign eachother keys. see webpage. In essence they recentralize the decentralized web-of-trust, in their own service.
- The ugly: 

NEVER UPLOAD YOUR PRIVATE KEY TO KEYBASE.IO OR ANYWHERE ELSE!
