# ATILA 2018 and New Economic Event Dataset
After helping setup the venue, I presented at ATILA 2018 (6th December) in Ghent.
I presented [my previous work on economic event detection in business news][1] here as well as *the newly created gold standard dataset for Economic Event Extraction*.

This new dataset defines ERE-like event schemata for 18 types and 43 subtypes.
It contains over 6000 event nuggets in 300 fully annotated news articles.
The work is part of [my PhD project SENTiVENT][3] for information extraction for financial applications.

This post is mainly for sharing the presentation slides.
