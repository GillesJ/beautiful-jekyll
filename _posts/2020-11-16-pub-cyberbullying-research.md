We provide a cross-domain evaluation framework for cyberbullying detection research to overcome the limitations of data scarcity in this field.
We also show that crowdsourcing data in a simulated lab setting is a valid way of generating data.
We have published new research as an extension from the [AMiCA project on cybersafety](https://amicaproject.be/).

This research was headed by [Chris Emmery](https://cmry.github.io/) ([CSAI](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/research/institutes-and-research-groups/ticc/csai), Tilburg University) and [CLiPS](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-groups/clips/) (Antwerp University).
