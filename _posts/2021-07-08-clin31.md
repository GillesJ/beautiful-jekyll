Our research group organizes the 31st edition of [Computational Linguistics in the Netherlands (CLIN31)](https://www.clin31.ugent.be/) this year.
Join me as I chair [the session on COVID-19: Stance and Opinion in Room B](https://www.clin31.ugent.be/programme/#oral-session-1) to get the latest research on sentiment analysis, stance and topic detection related to the coronavirus pandemic.

Later, I will also [present a poster](https://www.clin31.ugent.be/programme/#poster-session-2) on intermediate results in economic and financial polar fact processing.
