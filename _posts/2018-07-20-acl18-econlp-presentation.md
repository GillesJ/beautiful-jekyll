I went to ACL18, one of the largest NLP conferences last week.
I present my work on economic event detection in business news at the first Workshop on Economics and NLP.

ACL18 was overall an inspiring conference and networking experience.
I made a lot of new friends and managed to pick quite a few techniques and ideas to adapt for my own purposes.

This post is mainly for sharing the presentation slides, but here is an impression of my presentation as an extra:
