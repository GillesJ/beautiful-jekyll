I went to ACL18, one of the largest NLP conferences in the world last week.
I present my work on economic event detection in business news at the first Workshop on Economics and NLP.
Overall, ACL18 was an inspiring conference and networking experience despite my jetlag.
I met a lot of skilled people and managed to pick quite a few techniques and ideas to adapt for my own purposes.
The feedback I received on my work (and career options) was extremely valuable and makes the whole trip worth it.
Exploring Melbourne is just an added bonus.

This post is mainly for sharing the presentation slides, but here is an impression of my presentation as an extra:
