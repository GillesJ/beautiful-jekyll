Job opening for annotator student workers for economic events in the SENTiVENT project in English news articles.
The data annotation is part of the [SENTiVENT project on economic event extraction and sentiment analysis]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2018-06-17-sentivent-project.md %}).

# Detailed job description
You will be annotating economic event categories and their properties in business news articles.
Detailed annotation instructions are given to annotators describing the steps and categories to annotate.
We have a computer room for in-office work where you will be trained.
The annotation tool we use is WebAnno and is web-based: you only need a supported browser (Chrome or Edge) for remote working on your own computer.
Understanding the guidelines and economic news articles requires an excellent grasp of English.
You will also have to familiarize yourself with economic, financial and business terminology.
Annotation is done redundantly: each text is annotated by two annotators independently.
Subsequently conflicting annotations are resolved by discussion.

Annotating event categories is a cognitively challenging task which requires a lot of concentration and mental effort. We aim for 4 hour working days. If we determine an annotator can handle more without diminishing quality, the daily working hours can be increased.

## Working period
The estimated work required is for about 3+ weeks if we manage to recruit enough annotators. The period on the job posting was a taken broadly so we can find a period that overlaps for all candidate pairs. The duration of the annotation process also largely depends on the tempo and ability of the annotators and is difficult to accurately estimate.

## Remote working
Remote working is possible when the annotator has proven they can work independently and has good grasp of the guidelines.
We can not guarantee remote working, but if the quality of work is sufficient the annotator is allowed to work remotely.
Your output is remotely monitored through the annotation website.

The annotator are to be in office for an initial week of training and at the end of the annotation phase.
The final annotation is an adjudication phase were you discuss conflicting annotations with your colleague.

You can find more payment and legal information on the Jobdienst website.
